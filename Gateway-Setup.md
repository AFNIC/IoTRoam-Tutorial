 *	Attach the 868 MHz antenna to the LoRa mCard’s RF port.
 *	Attach the cellular antenna to the Conduit’s CELL port. If there are two antennas, connect the second one in the place where it is written ‘Aux’
 *	Power the Conduit by plugging in the provided AC-DC converter
 *	Check the LEDs in the Conduit
    *	PWR = Power
    *	Status = LED blinks when the OS is fully loaded
    *	LS = Link Status
