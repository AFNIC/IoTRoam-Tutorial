 1. [Verify] whether the required ports are open between the different interfaces  
 2. [Check] the Gateway Set up 
 3. [Validate] that the NS receives data from the RGW 
 4. [Make sure]  that the AS receives data from the NS  
 5. Verify that you have provisioned your NetID and JoinEUI to the [DNS] 
 6. For the Certificates
    * a.) Clone/Copy the required [Files] 
    * b.) The directory structure is as [here]
    * b.) Modify [intermediate-csr.json]  to suit you
    * c.) Modify "Certificate.json" in all subdirectories to suit your "CN" and host "IP addresses"
    * d.) For roaming, You have to modify the directory name to suit your NetId. In the [example], the NetID is "000000"
 7. Install [cfssl]. A Short installation [tutorial]
 8. Following has to done to run the [Makefile]
    * a.) Request your intermediate public and private certificate by sending mail to `"sandoche.balakrichenan@afnic.fr"` AND `"antoine.bernard@afnic.fr"`
    * b.) Copy the intermediate public and private certificate to the intermediate directory as specified in the directory structure as [here]: 
    * c.) Modify the `NetId` in the top of the `Makefile` to suit your `NetId`
    * d.) Run `make`
 9. Make sure that your `.toml`config files are correctly configured
    * a.) Sample [Network-Server-Config] file. For detailed information, [chirpstack-network-server-config] page
    * b.) Sample [Application-Server-Config] file. For detialed information, [chirpstack-application-server-config] page
10. Launch the NS and the AS 
    * a.) Initial [Configuration] of the Web interface : 
    * b.) One needs to add *Certain* Client certificates to the Web interface.
